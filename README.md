The construction of a Pythagoras tree begins with a square. A right-angled isosceles triangle is build on the top edge of the base square so that it's hypotenuse coincides with the edge. Squares are then constructed, each reduced by a linear factor of âˆš2/2, on each of the other two sides of this isosceles triangle. The same procedure is then applied recursively to the two smaller squares ad infinitum. The figures below show the first few iterations in the build process where there is still no overlapping of the squares.

From the 5th iteration some of the squares start overlapping each other.
